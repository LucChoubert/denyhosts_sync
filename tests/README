Run these tests from the project root directory using
 
  $ trial tests

Trial is the Twisted test runner. On Debian systems, it is part of the
python-twisted-core package.

This directory also contains some scripts that are not unit test and cannot be
run using trial: test.py, fill_database.py and sim_clients.py. The latter two
scripts are used for performance testing.
